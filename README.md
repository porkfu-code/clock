# clock
A simple 24h clock to show in the terminal with blinking colons to help track the seconds. It looks like this:

`18:17:56` or `18 17 57`

## To use it

`go run cmd/baseClock/baseClock.go`

## To build it

`go build cmd/baseClock/baseClock.go`

## To run the binary

`./baseClock`

## Stop the clock

Just use ctrl+c, I guess.
